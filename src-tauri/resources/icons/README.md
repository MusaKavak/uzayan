#Icons

The `.svg` files in this folder are not same as normal `.svg` files. All the unnecessary attributes were removed to minify the icon size. Because of that, they may not work elsewhere. 

For icons to implement the colors from the CSS, set the `class` attribute of the elements of the SVGs to `stroke` or `fill`.
